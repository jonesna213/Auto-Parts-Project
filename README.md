# Auto-Parts-Project

This project was created for the final project in my PHP with MySQL class. 
The objectives were:
*Home page with all parts displayed/search bar (at least 20 items) only people that are signed in can click the add to cart button
*View/edit profile page where the user can edit there information
*signup, login page (logout page but doesn't actually have a page)
*add item page for admin users only
*Items in cart page that shows all the items in the cart
*Checkout page (Dose not incorporate an actual purchace process)
*Receipt page that just shows the items that were ordered (doesn't actually do anything besides remove the items from the users cart)
Add to cart button on each item with a quantity field (turns into remove from cart button if its already in the cart)
*Nav menu with a home, view/edit profile, signup, login, logout and a cart icon that can be clicked to see the items in the cart
